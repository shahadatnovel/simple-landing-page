                Fruits are an excellent source of essential vitamins and minerals, and they are high in fiber. Fruits also provide a wide range of health-boosting antioxidants, including flavonoids. Eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables can reduce a person's risk of developing heart disease, cancer, inflammation, and diabetes.</p></div>

    <div class="cls5"><img src="nobel.jpg" width="400" height="200"><p>What is the main purpose of fruit?
        The main function of a fruit is to disperse and protect the seeds. A fruit contains seeds, and many fruits attract animals that feed on them allowing for the seeds to be dispersed away from the parent plant. The fruit also helps in preventing the seeds from getting dry.</p></div>
